- Add field "lastLP" in Summoner so we can calculate the gain in lp with each game
- Add field "teamDamagePercentage" (float: ig 0.18928992244050874) for GameData (present in "challenges").
- Get the image (probably from data dragon) - probably should implement a cache system for this.
- Add a 24h recap with the winrate for the day and number of lp gained.
